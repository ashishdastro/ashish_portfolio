      <h3>Artifact 1: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence – Historical Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        This presentation explores the evolution of Artificial Intelligence from its early foundations in the 1950s
        to today’s generative and cloud-based era. It highlights major breakthroughs such as the Turing Test, expert
        systems, deep learning, and the rise of transformer-based models like GPT.

      <h3>Artifact 2: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning – Real-World Applications</h3>
      <p>
        A comparative research report analyzing how Machine Learning and Deep Learning are applied in real-world
        use cases. It explores why classical ML models excel in structured data environments (like churn prediction)
        while Deep Learning dominates perception-based tasks (like image recognition).
